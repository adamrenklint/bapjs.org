title: Bap is a toolkit for making beats with Javascript and Web Audio
---
text:

Inspired by the workflow of MPC60, it combines the expressiveness of code with a modular and efficient process of making beats, for playback in modern browsers. Powered by a resilient internal clock running at 96 ticks per beat.

**A beat is made up of kits, patterns and sequences.**

Kits are collections of numbered slots, which contain one or many layers of samples and oscillators. One or many kits are connected to a pattern, which is a collection of numbered channels, and each channel can contain many notes. Patterns can be combined in rows and layers to sequences with variable tempo.

All Bap objects are state models and can be cloned and serialized, or manipulated at runtime.

**Bap turns your existing developer tools - text editor and browser - into a portable sequencer and beatmaking playground with version control.**

```js
var kit = bap.kit();
kit.slot(1).layer('site/files/sounds/kick.wav');
kit.slot(2).layer('site/files/sounds/snare.wav');
kit.slot(3).layer('site/files/sounds/hihat.wav');
var pattern = bap.pattern({ bars: 2, tempo: 90 });
pattern.channel(1).add(
  ['*.1.01',     'A1'],
  ['*.2.81',     'A1'],
  ['*.3.52',     'A1', null, 60],
  ['*.4.78',     'A1', null, 60, -20],
  ['*.odd.91', 'A2'],
  ['*.*.2%51', 'A3', null, 20]
);
bap.clock.sequence = pattern.kit('A', kit);
```

This page is just an intro, should try to sell the idea of what could be made with Bap, what it could be used for.

## Features

- expressive: note expressions, functions, math
- modular: kits and patterns/sequences, npm
- collaborative: use existing software dev tools, github, jsfiddle, etc

## Examples

- metronome
- boombap
- slices
- sequences
