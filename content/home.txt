title: Bap is a toolkit for making beats with Javascript and Web Audio
---
text:

Inspired by the workflow of MPC60, it combines the expressiveness of code with a modular and efficient approach to making beats, for playback in modern browsers. Powered by a resilient internal clock running at 96 ticks per beat.

**A beat is made up of kits, patterns and sequences.**

Kits are collections of numbered slots, which contains one or many layers of samples and oscillators. One or many kits are connected to a pattern, which is a collection of numbered channels, and each channel can contain many notes.

Patterns can be combined in rows and layers to sequences with variable tempo.

**All Bap objects are state models, and can be cloned and serialized.**

This page is just an intro, should try to sell the idea of what could be made with Bap, what it could be used for.

## Features

- expressive: note expressions, functions, math
- modular: kits and patterns/sequences, npm
- collaborative: use existing software dev tools, github, jsfiddle, etc

## Examples

- metronome
- boombap
- slices
- sequences
